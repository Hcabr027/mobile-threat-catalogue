Threat: Power Glitching
ThreatDescription: Power glitching microprocessors are designed to operate from a stable voltage wherein interruptions of the power supply are likely to crash running applications or reset the circuit. A power glitch will affect both the stored and the threshold values. Different internal capacities will cause the values to be influenced differently, possibly resulting in a misinterpretation of the actual value.
