ID: STA-11
Threat: Vulnerable Isolated Execution Environment Software
ThreatDescription: Isolated execution environments, such as a Trusted Execution Environment, often run on a dedicated hardware chip. It has access to areas of physical memory that are restricted from the mobile operating system, which are often used to protect high-value cryptographic keys and other secrets. If a vulnerability in either the execution environment's operating system or a program executing under it is exploited, an attacker may gain access to these keys or be able to obtain the output from sensitive cryptographic operations that require them.
ThreatOrigin: Extracting Qualcomm's KeyMaster Keys - Breaking Android Full Disk Encryption [^209]
ExploitExample:
CVEExample:
  - CVE-2016-0825
  - CVE-2016-5349
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Mobile Device User:
      - To decrease the latency between availability and installation of security fixes for isolated execution environments, configure devices (potentially using EMM solutions) to automatically install security updates, or at a minimum, provide automated notification to the user that security updates are available for installation.
    Enterprise:
      - To decrease the latency between availability and installation of security fixes for isolated execution environments, configure devices (potentially using EMM solutions) to automatically install security updates, or at a minimum, provide automated notification to the user that security updates are available for installation.
      - To decrease the risk of persistent and unpatched vulnerabilities in isolated execution environments in deployed devices, consider acquiring mobile devices from vendors and carriers with a history of addressing and releasing security updates in a timely fashion.
    Original Equipment Manufacturer:
      - Use TEE OS that provide integrity protections over trustlets, such as verification of digital signatures on installed trustlets, such as Trusty OS. [^222]
