Threat: Requiring Vulnerable App or Device
ThreatDescription: Organizations or individual users may develop and rely upon specific apps or devices to complete necessary work. Knowledge of a serious vulnerability affecting such an app or device increases the risk associated with using it to accomplish that work. However, the impact of being unable to complete the work as a result of abstaining from use of the app or device, may be unacceptable.
ThreatOrigin:
ExploitExample:
  - Stumping the Mobile Chipset [^70]
CVEExample:
  - CVE-2016-5340
  - CVE-2016-2059
  - CVE-2016-2503
  - CVE-2016-2504
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Mobile Device User:
      - Use iOS and Android runtime permission features to remove risky permissions (e.g. GPS access, contact list access, etc.) from unsupported apps or apps with known vulnerabilities.
      - Uninstall vulnerable apps from the device. Once a patched version is available for download, redownload and install the app.
    Enterprise:
      - Use iOS and Android runtime permission features to remove risky permissions (e.g. GPS access, contact list access, etc.) from unsupported apps or apps with known vulnerabilities.
      - Use MAM solutions to detect vulnerable apps and prevent access to enterprise resources while the app is installed.
      - Use MAM solutions to forcefully disable vulnerable apps until a patch is available and installed.
      - Use MAM solutions to temporarily revoke access to sensitive device sensors or OS-provided services.
