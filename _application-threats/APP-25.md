ThreatCategory: Malicious or privacy-invasive application
ID: APP-25
Threat: Abusing Existing Root Access
ThreatDescription: Rooting or jail-breaking an Android or iOS device significantly degrades its security architecture by enabling arbitrary apps to execute commands as root. A malicious app could, under an assumption some percentage of devices have been rooted or jail-broken, attempt to abuse implicit root privilege escalation.
ThreatOrigin:
ExploitExample:
  - How to clean up the Duh iPhone worm [^101]
CVEExample:
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Enterprise:
      - Deploy MAM or MDM solutions with policies that prohibit the side-loading of apps, which may bypass security checks on the app.
      - Deploy MAM or MDM solutions with policies that prohibit the installation of apps from 3rd party (unofficial) app stores.
      - For the lowest risk tolerance, deploy MDM or containerization solutions with policies that can detect and block access to enterprise resources by rooted/jail-broken devices.
      - Use application threat intelligence data to detect potential abuse of rooted/jail-broken BYOD devices
    Mobile Device User:
      - Use Android Verify Apps feature to identify harmful apps.
    Mobile App Developer:
      - To avoid launching applications that handle sensitive information on a rooted/jail-broken device, perform device integrity checking, such as using Android SafetyNet, Samsung Knox hardware-backed remote attestation, or other applicable remote attestation technologies device integrity attestation API
