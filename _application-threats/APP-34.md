Threat: App Provides Remote Control Over Device
ThreatDescription: Malicious apps built with effective code execution exploits against the mobile OS and the ability to receive remote commands can provide a resourceful attacker with considerable control over a compromised mobile device. Typical usage of remote control functionality has been using build-in sensors, such as the microphone and camera, to surveil the user. However, an attacker can potentially exercise any capability of the device.
ThreatOrigin:
ExploitExample:
  - Dendroid malware can take over your camera, record audio, and sneak into Google Play [^237]
  - Mobile RAT attack makes Android the ultimate spy tool [^112]
CVEExample:
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Enterprise:
      - Deploy MAM or MDM solutions with policies that prohibit the side-loading of apps, which may bypass security checks on the app.
      - Deploy MAM or MDM solutions with policies that prohibit the installation of apps from 3rd party (unofficial) app stores.
      - Use app-vetting tools or services to identify apps that appear to provide remote control to an attacker.
      - Use application threat intelligence services to identify apps flagged as providing remote access to an attacker
    Mobile Device User:
      - Use Android Verify Apps feature to identify potentially harmful apps.
      - When installing apps, be suspicious of those requesting access to OS services or sensors that do not appear related to the functionality of the app
