Threat: Bluetooth Encryption Brute-Force
ThreatOrigin: Guide to Bluetooth Security (SP 800-121) [^28]
ThreatDescription: Brute-force decryption of Bluetooth 4.0 or older communication due to weak BR/EDR encryption algorithm.
ExploitExample:
CVEExample:
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Mobile Device User:
      - To resist brute-force decryption attacks, use the maximum PIN length and encryption key sizes available on configurable Bluetooth devices.
      - Restrict the use of older Bluetooth devices with a static or 4-digit PIN to very low-risk use cases.
      - To prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification to data transmitted over a compromised Bluetooth session, use Bluetooth applications that provide strong over-the-top encryption to data prior to transmission over the Bluetooth interface.
    Enterprise:
      - Restrict the use of older Bluetooth devices with a static or 4-digit PIN to very low-risk use cases.
      - To prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification to data transmitted over a compromised Bluetooth session, use Bluetooth applications that provide strong over-the-top encryption to data prior to transmission over the Bluetooth interface.
