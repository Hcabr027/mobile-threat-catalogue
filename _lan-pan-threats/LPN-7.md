Threat: BlueStumbling
ThreatOrigin: 'War Nibbling: Bluetooth Insecurity [^O-Whitehouse-1]'
ThreatDescription: BlueStumbling occurs when adversaries discover, locate, and/or identify users based on their Bluetooth device addresses.
ExploitExample:
CVEExample:
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Mobile Device User:
      - To reduce opportunity for this attack, disable Bluetooth when that feature is not in use
      - To increase the complexity of this attack, consider the use of devices that support Bluetooth 4.0 and later. Bluetooth 4.0 allows for the address used by a device to change frequently, preventing persistent association of a given address with any user. See __Security, Bluetooth Smart (Low Energy)__ [^38]
      - As pairing with an attacker-controlled device greatly increases the success of this attack, never authorize an unanticipated pairing request.
      - As interception of pairing messages facilitates this attack, when pairing devices, observe physical security, such as pairing devices in a secure location outside of which, the ability of an attacker to intercept Bluetooth messages is remote.
    Enterprise:
      - To increase the complexity of this attack, consider the use of devices that support Bluetooth 4.0 and later. Bluetooth 4.0 allows for the address used by a device to change frequently, preventing persistent association of a given address with any user. See __Security, Bluetooth Smart (Low Energy)__ [^38]
