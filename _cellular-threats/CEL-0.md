ThreatCategory: Cellular Air Interface
ID: CEL-0
Threat: Air Interface Eavesdropping
ThreatOrigin:
  - '3G Security: Security Threats and Requirements (Release 4) [^165]'
  - LTE Architecture Overview and Security Analysis (Draft NISTIR 8071) [^166]
ThreatDescription: An attacker intercepts traffic between a mobile device and a base station. (E.g., unencrypted data is intercepted over the air during the cellular phone and base station's radio communications.)
ExploitExample:
  - Attacking phone privacy [^175]
  - A man-in-the-middle attack on UMTS [^176]
CVEExample:
PossibleCountermeasures:
    Original Equipment Manufacturer:
      - Use of a ciphering indicator in the interface of the mobile device to inform the user as to whether or not user data (e.g. voice calls, SMS/MMS messages, data) are being encrypted.
    Mobile OS Developer:
      - Use of a ciphering indicator in the interface of the mobile device to inform the user as to whether or not user data (e.g. voice calls, SMS/MMS messages, data) are being encrypted.
    Mobile Network Operator:
      - Network level air interface encryption for user-plane traffic.
    Mobile Device User:
      - To prevent an attacker who intercepts traffic on the unencrypted channel between a mobile device and a base station, use a mobile VPN or another third-party over-the-top encryption solution to encrypt data prior to transmission over the air interface.
    Enterprise:
      - To prevent an attacker who intercepts traffic on the unencrypted channel between a mobile device and a base station, use a mobile VPN or another third-party over-the-top encryption solution to encrypt data prior to transmission over the air interface.
